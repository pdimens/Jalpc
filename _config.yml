  desc: My family immigrated to the U.S. at the age of 2 from Belarus, and growing up through the New York City public school system I wanted to be [in this chronological order] a paleontologist, a garbage man, a veterinarian, a chef, a veterinarian again, and finally a marine biologist. I'm technically a marine ecologist now, but younger-me probably couldn't appreciate that nuance. I study long term migratory fish behavior by comparing their genomes and hypothesizing what forces are driving population subdivision. It's pretty fascinating stuff, but the life histories of migratory marine fishes can really complicate the analytical part of this work, which only makes it that much more interesting (and frustrating)! When I'm not trapped in my office chair and monologue-ing about how amazing Linux is (just try it!!), I like to spend time with my dog, hike, swim, hunt and be involved in some kind of creative project, from writing music, to building furniture, graphic designing, tweaking stuff on my Raspberry Pi, etc. Seriously, just try Linux.   # Describe yourself.
