A lot of science happens behind closed doors, in sometimes cold and/or dark spaces. When you do see the light of day and have to communicate your research to the greater community (scientific or otherwise), you should be able to do so effectively. 

**effectively?**

Seems obvious, right? Well, let's first explore what that means. Thinking you do a good or good enough job is great (and I admire the confidence!), but your idea of "good" and your audience's reception of your presentation can be quite different. So, let's take a step back and outline the goals of "effectively" so we know what boxes to check off when we build and ultimately give these presentations. 



## Effective Presentation

- everyone understands why you're doing the work

- everyone understands the basics or specifics of the work you're doing

- everyone is able to follow along with you throughout the entire presentation

- everyone isn't hoping someone pulls a fire alarm or calls in a bomb threat just so they can be freed from the torture they eagerly and foolishly walked into a few minutes prior


**Pretty simple, I think. But, how we do we do that?**

## 2 Don't wave around your smarts because of your insecurities

<p>This one sounds way more personal, doesn't it? Well, it is. Like I said before, you will have a mixed bag of people seeing your presentations, and you need not be intimidated by anyone there! Do a bit of reflection and think about how jargon-heavy your presentations are. At conferences, you are surrounded by future job competition, potential employers, collaborators, etc., so the motivation for being at your "most marketable" is there. But, you're human. Be human. Waving around fancy terms and leaving everyone in the dark is alienating to your audience. If you're an intelligent person, that will come across a lot better when you casually explain the gist of Coalescent Theory within 15 seconds to a room full of people. When was the last time you were truly impressed by a person speaking in fancy jargon and you just blankly nodding?</p>

<h2>Part 2 : structuring your presentation</h2>

<p>This section wasn't initially here, but this issue has come up enough times to merit a little discussion. Presentations are pretty much how you would write a publication:</p>
<h4>Title:Authors >> Intro >> Methods >> Results >> Discussion</h4>

<p>The difference here is that you usually have ~15 minutes to cover all of that material, except you don't really, because good etiquette is to leave a few minutes for questions, so you really have 12 minutes of presentation and 3 minutes of an anything-can-happen emotional gauntlet (questions). Your first instinct might be to ignore the Title (10-30sec tops) and divvy out those 12 precious minutes as 3min per section, which is totally ok. If you would like your presentation to be a bit more specialized, then here's my biggest piece of advice:</p>

<h4>ask yourself what's the most important thing you want your audience to know
(because you really don't have enough time to cover everything effectively)</h4>

<p>I regularly have a tough time deciding this myself. Science has a lot of parts to it, and you might feel like you are short changing people by not telling them "all of the things." But, take a breath and understand that the audience doesn't know the details you aren't telling them. I very regularly have to remind myself of this because I'm prone to wanting to talk about every little detail. I think it's important to make the distinction that I'm not saying "withhold information" so much as I'm saying "there isn't enough time for all of this."</p>

<h3>so...</h3>

<p>What's the important part? Is it important to you that everyone leaves the room understanding your novel methods, like the way you sampled, or maybe what statistics/models you used? Are the results most important? Are the inferences and implications from your results most important? Whichever it is you pick, I suggest you shave off time from the other 3 categories to give you more time to be thorough with that thing and don't bore yourself or others by over-explaining the other parts.</p>

<h2>Miscellaneous advice</h2>
<ul>
<li>your presentation should look good, as discussed in the design guidelines</li>

<li>presentations should be in 4:3 aspect ratio because conference A/V gear doesn't support good 16:9. in other words, if you do 16:9, your talk will have large black bars on top and bottom and be squished ​</li>

<li>bullet points should be summary-esque, not the words you are literally saying out loud as they appear on screen</li>

<li>avoid "uh" and "um." Taking pauses is totally fine.</li>

<li>don't lock eyes with a single person in the audience for the entire presentation</li>

<li>don't trust anyone who tells you otherwise</li>

<li>let your presentation slides emphasize the important content on the screen. Think about it: you spent all that time working on your talk, and suddenly as you're presenting it you finally realize some things are important enough to wildly circle with a laser pointer? I have no beef with laser pointers, but I do have beef with lack of foresight.</li>

<li>allow your voice to modulate, you aren't a robot (be human, remember!)</li>

<li>repeating a question aloud before answering it is a good courtesy for the audience</li>

<li>you're absolutely allowed to use your hands when you speak</li>

<li>don't have that forced "camp counselor" energy- people hate that</li>
</ul>

<h3>super random pro-tips</h3>

<ul>
<li>antiperspirants should be applied the night before after you take a shower (when your pores are open and then absorbed overnight) and then deodorant applied the following morning</li>

<li>if you sweat when you present (like me) and your forehead looks super shiny when that happens (like me), consider putting on foundation to even out the skin tones</li>

<li><b>or</b> if you're a guy and insecure about putting on makeup, get a decent exfoliating facial scrub and wash your face with it the morning of your presentation- similar smoothing effect</li>

<li>do not... <b>do not</b> give your talks a stupid comical theme that's just saturated in awful word play, like Doctor Who or Smurfs. The world will thank you for it ​</li>
</ul>
